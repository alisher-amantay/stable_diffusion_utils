# Stable Diffusion utilities

This repo contains some ready snippets as well as ready conda yml config for using Stable Diffusion.

In `run.ipynb` there are 3 different functionalities:
- Text-to-image pipeline: given a prompt generate an image.
- Image-to-image pipeline: given a prompt and image generate an image.
- Interpolation between prompts: given 2 prompts, create a video slowly interpolating images from one prompt to another.

All snippets switch off explicit content filter.
